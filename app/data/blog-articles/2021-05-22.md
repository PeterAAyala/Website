It's been some time since I made a substantive update to my website. In fact, it's now coming up to a year on the dot when I last updated the site. When I first created it, I planned to more actively create instructional guides and blog about side projects that I've been working on. That's still my intention with this site, but unfortunately a string of time-intensive cases at Bain coupled with general uncertaintity about what I wanted to work on meant that the past year has flown by without any significant changes.  

I'm not particularly sure what I'll blog about or the frequency at which I will, but I do have a rough sense. I've also started some small projects that I plan on writing more robust tutorials for. 

This may bomb, it may not, but either way it'll be a forcing function for me to continue something that I'm interested in.
