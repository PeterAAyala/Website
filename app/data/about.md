#### Intro

I am a 2019 graduate from Harvard College and currently an Associate Consultant at Bain & Company's Boston office. My professional interests are largely within the technology sector with a focus on Fin-tech, Ed-tech, and advanced analytics. My personal interests include houseplants, digital drawing, reading, and coding, and I use this website as a way to host small and independent projects I work on. 


#### Currently
As an Associate Consultant I have been able to work on a variety of projects across industries, all while developing a robust business skillset to complement my technical background. I am currently considering opportunities outside of consulting in areas of business development at an early-stage tech company. 

Specific project experiences include:
+ Completed 10 diligences for a top ten hedge fund. Responsibilities spanned B2C and B2B survey creation and analysis, primary research interviews, financial analysis, market modeling, peer benchmarking, and other bespoke analysis. Industries include social media, IT system hardware, online travel agencies, packaging, mining & smelting, grocery, chemicals, healthcare SaaS, and others.
+ M&A Strategy for a multinational food CPG company, assessing 7 companies across 2 high priority growth segments with implications to CPG Co.'s supply chain, route-to-market, and operating model
+ Finance Transformation for an Information Management client with an overall ambition to reduce department spend by 50%. Initially focused on the Accounting sub-function and co-created a future state org design that met overall cost envelope. Transitioned to act as the team's assistant project manager, ensuring progress against outlined initiatives across Finance sub-functions.
